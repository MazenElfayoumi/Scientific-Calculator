# Scientific Calculator
 This project is a C++ implementation of a basic Scientific Calculator. The calculator can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a stack-based approach. This project also demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques to structure the calculator's functionality.
